# Daily Checklist App

This repository contains the Swift source files for a simple checklist application built with SwiftUI. The code targets both macOS and iOS.

## Building

1. Open **Xcode** and create a new **App** project (SwiftUI interface, Swift language). Choose either an iOS or macOS target.
2. Delete the template `ContentView.swift` and `YourAppNameApp.swift` files generated by Xcode.
3. Copy the contents of the `DailyChecklist` directory from this repository into your project.
4. Make sure all the Swift files are added to the app target.
5. Build and run the project. You should see the **"üìù Daily Checklist"** interface with Morning and Night sections, a progress bar, and notification reminders.

Tasks persist to `UserDefaults`, reset each day, and the app schedules daily local notifications for reminders.
