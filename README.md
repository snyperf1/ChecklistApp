# Daily Checklist App

This repository contains the Swift source files for a simple macOS checklist application built with SwiftUI.

## Building

1. Open **Xcode** and create a new **App** project (macOS target, SwiftUI interface, Swift language). You do **not** need Core Data.
2. Delete the template `ContentView.swift` and `YourAppNameApp.swift` files generated by Xcode.
3. Copy the contents of the `DailyChecklist` directory from this repository into your project.
4. Make sure all the Swift files are added to the app target.
5. Build and run the project. You should see a window titled **"üìù Daily Checklist"** with Morning and Night sections.

Tasks persist to `UserDefaults` and reset each day.
